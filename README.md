Solving the 24 game

I originally did it in C and handle my own list processing, now converted to python.
This short little program uses recursion to solve the game of 24. Given 4 cards, compete with your friends to write an arithmetic expression that equals 24.
For example, given 2 3 4 8. The expression is ((8  - 4)  * 3)  * 2 

Use the command line to pass your list (not fixed to 4). change the GOAL constant if you want a different goal.
