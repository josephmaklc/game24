Solving the 24 game

I originally did it in C and handle my own list processing, now converted to python.
This short little program uses recursion to solve the game of 24. Given 4 cards, compete with your friends to write an arithmetic expression that equals 24.
For example, given 2 3 4 8. One solution is ((8  - 4)  * 3)  * 2 

You can buy your own set [here](https://www.amazon.com/24-Game-Single-Digit-cards/dp/B002AODZFQ/ref=sr_1_2)

Use the command line to pass your list (not fixed to 4). change the GOAL constant if you want a different goal.
